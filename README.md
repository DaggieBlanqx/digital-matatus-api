Digital matatus
========

** work in progress **

This is a javascript application that serves up the data collected from the [digital matatus](www.digitalmatatus.com) in a usable form.

The node.js server sends JSON while angular and leaflet.js are used on the frontend in the `public/` directory

```
/api/routes
/api/shapes
/api/trips
```

All data endpoints can be found in `server/config/routes.js`
